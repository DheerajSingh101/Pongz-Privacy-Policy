      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>Welcome to Pongz ("we", "our", or "us"). Pixelstack Studios Pte Ltd ("Pixelstack"), a company incorporated in Singapore, operates the Pongz mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and the choices you have regarding your information.</p>

      <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>We collect several types of information to operate and improve Pongz. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, username, email address, and password when you register. We also collect profile information provided via third-party login providers (e.g. Google, Facebook) such as profile name, email, and profile picture when you choose those sign-in options.</li>
        <li><strong>Gameplay information:</strong> match history, game progress, rankings, achievements, and in‑game settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Device and technical information:</strong> device model, operating system and version, app version, IP address, language settings, crash logs, diagnostic data, and cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment information:</strong> records of purchases made through Apple App Store or Google Play. We do not collect or store credit card details — all payments are processed by the relevant app store.</li>
        <li><strong>Location information:</strong> not collected currently. In future releases we may request your permission to access approximate or precise location data to enable location-based features; this will always be optional and require explicit consent.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>authenticating accounts and managing user profiles;</li>
        <li>processing purchases and in‑app transactions;</li>
        <li>analyzing app performance and usage via tools such as Firebase and Google Analytics;</li>
        <li>detecting and preventing fraud, abuse, and security incidents;</li>
        <li>communicating updates, service messages, and (with consent) marketing or promotional messages;</li>
        <li>supporting future features such as ads, leaderboards, and user-generated content moderation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
      <p>We will not sell or rent your personal information. We may share data with third parties only as necessary to provide the App, for legal reasons, or as part of business transactions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> hosting, analytics (e.g., Firebase, Google Analytics), push notifications, and customer support services;</li>
        <li><strong>Payment processors:</strong> Apple App Store and Google Play for handling transactions;</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising partners:</strong> if and when in‑app advertising is enabled in the future (only after appropriate disclosures and, where required, consent);</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> to comply with applicable law or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Retention</h3>
      <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide services and fulfill the purposes described in this policy, and to meet legal or accounting obligations. When data is no longer required it will be deleted or anonymized.</p>

      <h3>5. Your Rights & Choices</h3>
      <p>Depending on your local laws, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data. You can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>update account details in-app (where provided);</li>

        <li>opt out of marketing communications via in-app settings or by using links provided in emails;</li>
        <li>withdraw consent for optional features (e.g., location) at any time through device settings or in-app controls.</li>

We will work with you to address concerns promptly.</p>

      <h3>7. Security</h3>
      <p>We employ reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no internet-based service can be guaranteed 100% secure; please use unique passwords and take care when using shared devices.</p>

      <h3>8. International Transfers</h3>
      <p>Your information may be processed, stored, or transferred to countries other than your own if necessary to provide the service. We will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure appropriate protections are in place when data is transferred across borders.</p>
